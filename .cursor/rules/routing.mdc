# Routing

This project uses the Next.js App Router.

- Each folder inside `app/` represents a route segment.
- `page.tsx` is the UI for a route segment.
- `layout.tsx` is the UI that is shared across multiple pages.
- Dynamic routes can be created by using folders with brackets, e.g., `app/users/[id]/page.tsx`.
